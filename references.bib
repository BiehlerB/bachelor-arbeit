	abstract={Much as we hate to admit it, most prototyping practice lacks a sophisticated understanding of the broad concepts of prototypingand its strategic position within the development process. Often we overwhelm with a high fidelity prototype that designs us into a corner. Or, we can underwhelm with a prototype with too much ambiguity and flexibility to be of much use in the software development process. This book will help software makersdevelopers, designers, and architectsbuild effective prototypes every time: prototypes that convey enough information about the product at the appropriate time and thus set expectations appropriately. This practical, informative book will help anyonewhether or not one has artistic talent, access to special tools, or programming abilityto use good prototyping style, methods, and tools to build prototypes and manage for effective prototyping. Features * A prototyping process with guidelines, templates, and worksheets; * Overviews and step-by-step guides for 9 common prototyping techniques; * An introduction with step-by-step guidelines to a variety of prototyping tools that do not require advanced artistic skills; * Templates and other resources used in the book available on the Web for reuse; * Clearly-explained concepts and guidelines; * Full-color illustrations, and examples from a wide variety of prototyping processes, methods, and tools. Jonathan Arnowitz is a principal user experience designer at SAP Labs and is the co-editor-in-chief of Interactions Magazine. Most recently Jonathan was a senior user experience designer at Peoplesoft. He is a member of the SIGCHI executive committee, and was a founder of DUX, the first ever joint conference of ACM SIGCHI, ACM SIGGRAPH, AIGA Experience Design Group, and STC. Michael Arent is the manager of user experience design at SAP Labs, and has previously held positions at Peoplesoft, Inc, Adobe Systems, Inc, Sun Microsystems, and Apple Computer, Inc. He holds several U.S. patents. Nevin Berger is design director at Ziff Davis Media.

	publisher={Elsevier Science},
	abstract={Today many companies are employing a user-centered design (UCD) process, but for most companies, usability begins and ends with the usability test. Although usability testing is a critical part of an effective user-centered life cycle, it is only one component of the UCD process. This book is focused on the requirements gathering stage, which often receives less attention than usability testing, but is equally as important. Understanding user requirements is critical to the development of a successful product. Understanding Your Users is an easy to read, easy to implement, how-to guide on usability in the real world. It focuses on the "user requirements gathering" stage of product development and it provides a variety of techniques, many of which may be new to usability professionals. For each technique, readers will learn how to prepare for and conduct the activity, as well as analyze and present the data all in a practical and hands-on way. In addition, each method presented provides different information about the user and their requirements (e.g., functional requirements, information architecture, task flows). The techniques can be used together to form a complete picture of the users requirements or they can be used separately to address specific product questions. These techniques have helped product teams understand the value of user requirements gathering by providing insight into how users work and what they need to be successful at their tasks. Case studies from industry-leading companies demonstrate each method in action. In addition, readers are provided with the foundation to conduct any usability activity (e.g., getting buy-in from management, legal and ethical considerations, setting up your facilities, recruiting, moderating activities) and to ensure the incorporation of the results into their products. Covers all of the significant requirements gathering methods in a readable, practical way Presents the foundation readers need to prepare for any requirements gathering activity and ensure that the results are incorporated into their products Includes invaluable worksheet and template appendices Includes a case study for each method from industry leaders Written by experienced authors who teach conference courses on this subject to usability professionals and new product designers alike.}

Dabei schafft das Lehrbuch vielfältig den methodischen Brückenschlag von empirischer Sozialforschung und soziologischer Theorie. Es stellt Verfahren und Sachverhalte nicht nur vor, sondern erklärt sie verständlich. Die kritische Darstellung auch der neueren Entwicklungen der Methoden der empirischen Sozialforschung und ihrer Grundlagen weist über andere Lehrbücher hinaus. Auch daher ist dieses Lehrbuch das am häufigsten zitierte Lehrbuch zum Thema in deutscher Sprache.Für die 11. Auflage wurde der Band u.a. um Abschnitte über Big Data in den Sozialwissenschaften, zu adaptiven Designs bei Befragungen und zum Web-Scraping erweitert.}

	abstract={The paradigm shift triggered by Industry 4.0 leads to a fast rising number of industrial machinery and collaborative robots that increases the need for flexible customization of production processes and automation workflows. End-user programming of industrial robots has become an essential capability for all areas in industry. In this paper, we investigate the applicability of block-based programming languages for large and complex robot programs. Therefore, we implemented a real-world program for industrial robots using Blockly, a block-based visual language, and assessed the results regarding portability, readability, understandability, and maintainability. Our findings are, that (1) large and complex real-world robot programs can be expressed in Blockly, (2) that the readability and understandability of such programs is equal to conventional flow-chart based programming languages, and (3) that the maintainability of Blockly programs can even be considered better than in flowchart based languages. Our results and findings serve as basis for usability studies with end-users in robot programming.}
